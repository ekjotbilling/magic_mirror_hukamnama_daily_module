Proof of concept module for MagicMirror to show line by line hukamnama

## Here are some quick steps to set it up:

1. Setup [the MagicMirror project](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
1. Inside the MagicMirror/modules folder, clone this module. Then rename the folder to "hukamnamaDaily" (exact name is important)
1. Inside the MagicMirror/config folder, copy "config.js.sample" to "config.js" if "config.js" does not exist.
1. In the config.js file, there is a list of modules, their positions and more, which you can change according to your needs. But for a quick change, just replace the module name "compliments" to "hukamnamaDaily" (exact name is important)
1. Your MagicMirror project should be ready to present this module.
